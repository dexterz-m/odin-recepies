    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Coquito is a traditional holiday drink that originated in Puerto Rico.
         In Spanish, coquito means "little coconut."
          The beverage is coconut-based and spiked with rum. 
          Rich and creamy coquito, which is often thickened with egg yolks, is similar to eggnog.
           In fact, sometimes it's referred to as "Puerto Rican eggnog."
