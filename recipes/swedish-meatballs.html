        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p></li>
        <li><p>Place bread crumbs into a small bowl; mix in cream. Allow to stand until crumbs absorb cream, about 10 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Meanwhile, melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until light brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer onion to a mixing bowl.</p></li>
        <li><p>Mix ground beef, ground pork, egg, brown sugar, salt, black pepper, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger with onion in the mixing bowl. Lightly mix in bread crumbs and cream.</p></li>
        <li><p>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Pinch off about 1 1/2 tablespoon meat mixture per meatball; form into balls. Place meatballs into the skillet and cook, turning often, until browned, about 5 minutes. Insides of meatballs will still be pink.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place browned meatballs into a baking dish, pour in chicken broth, and cover with foil.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are tender, about 40 minutes. Remove meatballs to a serving dish.</p></li>
        <li><p>Pour pan drippings into a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk flour into drippings until smooth.</p></li>
        <li><p>Gradually whisk in enough beef broth to total about 2 1/2 cups liquid.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bring gravy to a simmer, whisking constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Just before serving, whisk in sour cream. Season with salt and black pepper. Serve gravy with meatballs</p></li>
